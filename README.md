<li>Input boxes at top left of screen are editable values controlling how many rows and columns (and therefore, how many digits of pi) are visible on screen.</li>
<li>Each circle is colored with it's STROKE to be representative of it's digit of pi, and it's FILL to be representative of the following digit.</li>
